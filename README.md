# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

This is my solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ).  
Frontend Mentor challenges help me improve my front-end development skills by building real-world components and layouts.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom Fonts using `@font-face`
- Accessible list-based button structure
- Vanilla CSS styling

---

### What I learned

- How to use **Flexbox** for vertical and horizontal alignment.
- How to create a **responsive card component**.
- How to import and use **custom local fonts** with `@font-face`.
- Structuring links with `<ul>` and `<li>` for better semantics and accessibility.
- Applying **hover and active states** for a more interactive experience.

```css
.links a {
  display: block;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  text-decoration: none;
  width: 100%;
}
```
### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Building more accessible components.
- Improving CSS architecture and using BEM or utility classes.
- Learning JavaScript interactivity for form validation and dynamic behavior.
- Exploring component libraries or CSS frameworks like Tailwind.
